	* In the provided Find.java file, complete the locateSequence method. 
  * For a given target sequence (non-empty array of integers), the method 
  * searches the input array (of integers) to find an occurrence of the 
  * target sequence if it is present. If the sequence is present, the 
  * method returns the array index position of where it starts in the array. 
  * If the sequence is not present, the method returns -1.
